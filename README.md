## Project Overview üîç

This project is a full-stack application aimed at creating a user interface (UI) within the monday.com platform to interact with board data. The front-end is developed using Next.js, TypeScript, and integrates monday.com's React UI Components Library. The UI allows users to search through country data stored on a monday.com board, display filtered results, and retrieve weather data for selected countries from a back-end API.
